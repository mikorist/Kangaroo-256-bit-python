# Kangaroo Algorithm for Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Kangaroo Algorithm** (also known as the **Pollard's Kangaroo Algorithm**) for solving the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**. The algorithm is designed to find the private key corresponding to a given public key on the **secp256k1 elliptic curve**, which is the curve used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

This implementation is **for educational, testing, and experimental purposes only**. It is not optimized for solving real-world cryptographic challenges and will not solve anything above **puzzle 66** due to computational limitations.

This version is based on: http://fe57.org/forum/thread.php?board=4&thema=1

## Introduction

The **Kangaroo Algorithm** is a probabilistic algorithm used to solve the **Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)** on elliptic curves. Given a public key `Q = k * G`, where `G` is the generator point of the curve and `k` is the private key, the algorithm aims to find `k` by simulating the movements of two "kangaroos" (tame and wild) on the elliptic curve.

This implementation focuses on the **secp256k1 curve** and is designed to solve small-scale puzzles (up to **puzzle 66**) for learning and experimentation purposes.

## How It Works

### Key Concepts
1. **Elliptic Curve Arithmetic**:
   - The implementation uses elliptic curve point addition and scalar multiplication to perform operations on the secp256k1 curve.
   - The curve parameters (modulo, order, generator point) are defined according to the secp256k1 standard.

2. **Kangaroo Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm uses two "herds" of kangaroos: the **tame kangaroos** and the **wild kangaroos**.
   - Tame kangaroos start from a known point within the range, while wild kangaroos start from the public key.
   - Both herds "hop" around the curve using a pseudo-random function (based on powers of two).
   - When a kangaroo lands on a **distinguished point (DP)**, it is stored in a lookup table.
   - If a tame kangaroo and a wild kangaroo land on the same distinguished point, the private key can be computed.

3. **Distinguished Points (DPs)**:
   - Distinguished points are points on the curve that satisfy a specific condition (e.g., their x-coordinate modulo a rarity value equals zero).
   - DPs are used to reduce the number of points that need to be stored and compared.

4. **Inverse Kangaroo**:
   - An additional optimization is implemented to handle the inverse of the public key, which can speed up the search in certain cases.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- The `gmpy2` library for efficient large integer arithmetic.

Install the required library using:
```
pip3 install gmpy2
```

# Running the Algorithm
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mikorist/Kangaroo-256-bit-python.git
cd Kangaroo-256-bit-python
```

#  Modify the parameters in the script:
<ul>
  <li>puzzle: The size of the puzzle (e.g., 40 for a 40-bit private key).</li>

  <li>compressed_public_key: The public key to solve (in compressed format).</li>

  <li>kangaroo_power: Controls the number of kangaroos in each herd (2^kangaroo_power).</li>
</ul>

# Run the script:
```
python3 kangaroo.py
```

# The script will output:

<ul>
  <li>The number of hops performed.</li>

  <li>The private key if found.</li>

  <li>The total time taken.</li>
</ul>
